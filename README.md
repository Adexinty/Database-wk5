**MySQL User and Index Management Queries**  

This repository contains a set of MySQL queries for managing database indexes and user permissions. The queries are designed to be simple and straightforward, suitable for basic database administration tasks.  

## Purpose  

The code includes four MySQL queries to:  
1. Drop an index from a table.  
2. Create a new user with a password.  
3. Grant specific permissions to a user.  
4. Change a user's password.  

## Prerequisites  

- MySQL Server: Ensure you have MySQL installed and running (version 5.7 or later recommended).  
- Administrative Access: You need a MySQL user with sufficient privileges to manage indexes and users (e.g., `root`).  
- Database: The `salesDB` database must exist for the third query to work. The `customers` table must exist with an index named `IdxPhone` for the first query
